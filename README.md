# UNFISHED, do not use unless you know the basics of node.js

# MultiLink

An Open Source, streaming platform agregator/syncer.

## Description

The goal here is to create an easy to run application that a streamer can use to link their chats from multiple platforms together.

E.g.

Beam.pro <-> Twitch.tv <-> Hitbox

Think BeamLink but you own it and it runs just for you.



## Development

### Getting Started
1. Clone
2. npm install
3. Write a config file.
4. For twitch grab your token from [http://twitchapps.com/tmi/](http://twitchapps.com/tmi/)
5. node index.js
